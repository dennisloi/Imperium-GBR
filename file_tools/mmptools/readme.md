# Status
- initial testing, unable to extract anything atm

# Notes
- The rle.mmp files don't contain the images, it contains only a header that contains pointers to the data stored inside the 'rle.mmp' file stored in the game root folder
- There is a c tool that can extract and recreate these files 'MMP-importer-exporter' (NemesisBmpToMmp and NemesisMmpToBmp). The current test file is HEAVILY inspired by that!
